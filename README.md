## Data Terrarium

###<mark>Slide - </mark><br>
A terrarium is a miniature, sealed ecosystem contained within a glass container. These systems rely solely on solar energy to sustain the plants, fungi, and small animals within them. The natural water and life cycles are balanced in such a way that they can thrive for extended periods sometimes even decades without external intervention.

###<mark>Slide-</mark><br>
Now, let's contrast this with traditional data centers. They're typically large and complex needing continuous electricity, water cooling, and bandwidth for data transmission to operate properly. This consumption of resources leads to substantial environmental impacts, making sustainability a significant concern for the industry. Instead, we are providing a net zero energy with a closed-loop cooling system, that's terrarium-inspired.

###<mark>Slide- </mark><br>
Our data terrarium prototype balances performance with energy efficiency, to perform various data processing tasks sustainably.
Starting with the central processing unit, our prototype utilizes the Intel N100 CPU. Equipped with four cores it can multitask while being energy efficient. We are also looking into other energy-efficient solutions such as  ARM-based CPUs.
Our prototype has 8GB of RAM and a 64GB boot drive. Additionally, our prototype is equipped with up to 16TB of SSD storage. This substantial storage capacity allows the data terrarium to handle datasets, store extensive amounts of data, and support data-intensive applications. With SSDs rather than traditional hard drives it can access data more quickly and reliably even (especially feels weird) in extreme temperatures.
In terms of power consumption, at only 6 to 35 watts our prototype is highly efficient. This is key to the sustainability of the data terrarium effectively operating with solar power and lithium phosphate batteries. The wide range ensures the flexibility to increase the number of solar panels to provide up to a KW, accommodating various workloads while optimizing energy usage.

###<mark>Slide- </mark><br>
Now, let's focus on the GPU integrated into our data terrarium prototype. This component is critical for handling the more intensive computational tasks that our system will perform.
We have chosen the NVIDIA L4 GPU for our prototype. Known for it's exceptional yet power-efficient performance. The 24 GB of GPU RAM at 72 watts provides substantial computational power and range, performing demanding applications, such as AI acceleration, energy-efficient execution of large-scale computation, genomics, and real-time processing, at low power.
Certain cases where the higher computational task is prioritized, we can substitute the Nvidia L4 with Nvidiaâ€™s A16 which has higher RAM per watt at 64 GB of GPU RAM, allowing it to excel in deep learning, running sophisticated models for user interaction with chatbots, and generative AI applications.
By integrating the NVIDIA L4 GPU or the NVIDIA A16, our data terrarium can perform high-performance inference tasks while adhering to our commitment to sustainability.

###<mark>Slide- </mark><br>
Equipped with a lithium-phosphate battery as backup, the system can continue to operate even during times of low sunlight or at night. The solar panels used, increase efficiency from 500 to 1000 watts of energy meeting and exceeding the power requirements. For safety we plan to place the batteries underground equipped with a fuse to prevent short circuits.
As opposed to traditional data centers which use significant amounts of water for cooling, the closed-loop cooling system we implemented uses an advanced heat exchange mechanism to dissipate heads without any water, ensuring efficient and sustainable cooling. This conserves water and maintains optimal operating temperatures for the hardware, enhancing reliability and longevity.
It also allows our data terrarium to be an enclosed system, only requiring solar energy as external input, and data transmitted over WiFi, as the primary output.

###<mark>Slide- </mark><br>
To maximize the efficiency of our data terrariums, much like how you'd put a traditional terrarium in a sunnier spot in the winter or cooler spot in the summer for optimal solar energy absorption. We propose using a sophisticated scheduling program that leverages GIS data to find those places that will provide our terrariums with the most solar energy throughout the year, allowing them to operate with a net-zero external energy input maximizing sustainability.
To further enhance this system, we envision creating a network of data terrariums for distributed computing, These data terrariums can also be used in conjunction with the eco data collectors, offloading computing and inference from the EDCs to our data terrarium, effectively making it a central point of communication for the end user. Internet access can be achieved through satellite-based internet such as StarLink.
Our goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of this concept at a small scale initially. By starting small, we can carefully monitor and refine the system, ensuring it works seamlessly before scaling up. Once the system is perfected, we plan to apply the lessons learned to larger data centers. The insights gained from these initial deployments will allow us to develop advanced software capable of predicting solar capacity needs and improving sustainability for larger installations.

###<mark>Slide- </mark><br>
Data terrariums present several compelling advantages. Firstly, they are environmentally friendly, utilizing solar energy and reducing reliance on external resources. This approach minimizes the carbon footprint of data processing. Secondly, they are resilient; being self-sustaining means they can continue operating independently of the grid, providing a reliable solution even in remote or off-grid locations. Thirdly, they are cost-effective. With low operational costs and an affordable initial setup, they offer an economical solution for various data processing needs.
The applications for data terrariums are vast. They can power deep learning models, enabling user interactions with chatbots and handling complex image and video processing tasks. By harnessing the power of the Nvidia L4 GPU, efficient solar panels, and intelligent power management, our data terrariums provide a reliable and eco-friendly platform for various data processing tasks.
